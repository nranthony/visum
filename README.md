# VisÂµm - Laser Scanning Control GUI

Laser scanning microscope control software GUI written in Pascal using LabView NIDAQ APIs and National Instruments cards.  This is an old project that was written in Delphi 7 (may transfer to Free Pascal / Lazarus IDE without too much headache).  While developed for a very specific hardware setup, the bones of the laser scanning control may be beneficial to those developing or optimizing their own.
